GovAssist – Government Scheme Recommender System
Project Overview
GovAssist is a citizen-centric web application designed to bridge the gap between government welfare schemes and the general public by helping users discover the most relevant schemes based on their personal profile. With a user-friendly interface and intelligent filters, it provides recommendations tailored to users' age, income, occupation, education, and category (e.g., women, farmers, students).

Many eligible citizens remain unaware of government schemes due to lack of accessibility, awareness, or digital literacy. GovAssist addresses this issue by serving as a digital guide for government welfare programs. It simplifies the process of filtering and understanding schemes, thereby promoting inclusive growth and social equity.
